# Black Desert Online Class Picker Python Tool
### I had many friends who were indecisive on picking a new class, so I quickly wrote this up to force them to chose, the usability is simple...follow the prompt.

## Example of the code working:
Class List: ['Warrior', 'Ranger', 'Sorceress', 'Berserker', 'Tamer', 'Musa', 'Maehwa', 'Valkyrie', 'Kunoichi', 'Ninja', 'Wizard', 'Witch', 'Mystic', 'Striker', 'Lahn', 'Archer', 'Dark Knight', 'Shai', 'Guardian', 'Hashashin', 'Nova', 'Sage', 'Corsair', 'Drakania', 'Woosa', 'Maegu']


Please follow the prompt, remember its case sensitive...

<br>Any class you wish to not randomly pick? exit to exit:	Warrior
<br>Any class you wish to not randomly pick? exit to exit:	Ranger
